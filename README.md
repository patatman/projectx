# Project X
We still need a name for the project, so any suggestions are welcome
Status: Heavy in development

## Intro
We liked https://openflixr.com alot, and even worked on the project together with @mediajunkie but we decided we wanted something else.
We wanted to containerize our HTPC and make it super lightweight and efficient.

## Why?
Because why not? We wanted to put our knowledge of SaltStack and Docker to the test. 
Our primary goal was to learn, and to have fun along the way.

## How do I use it?
For now, you don't. We're still to busy with development to release anything.
We're busy figuring out a way to have a Dev enviroment which is the same everytime you run in. Thus giving all devs the same enviroment to test in and experiment. Currently we're using Vagrant for this job, combined with SaltStack.
This might change in the future however.

## When is it ready?
We don't know, as long a we have some spare evenings and don't get stuck on huge things we might have a working image by this summer.

## Roadmap?
Check the Issues for all our features and see the project for the current status of those features.
We're doing our best to plan these things, so we can make the most of our time fixing  the image.
Most of the time we add cool stuff, and it might not make it in the first version. Any suggestions are welcome, and will be put on the roadmap.

## Anything else?
No, that's it.
